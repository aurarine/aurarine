## Hello guys, it's me!

My name is Karine, I'm a computer science student and just a girl who loves to code and solve problems.
She/her | Brazilian
pt-br and eng | learning spanish

I'm learning Python and the framework Django 🫶🏻
Working on projects to show my learning journey
I'll be posting some exercises that I do to practice alongside with my main project that will be a 
user management system which will allow users to sign in, login, do profile updates and recover their password if ever needed.

Thx for reading me!
